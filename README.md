## Week 8 Homework Project Skill Distillery

#### Description
This website lists all of the affordable restaurants in the Denver Metro area. It allows users the ability to add, update, and delete from the database. This app lists the restaurants name, phone number, address, the category it's in, and the minimum and maximum prices per food item. This app was created to help people eat on a friendly budget.

#### How It Works
* Users are welcomed with a homepage that displays all the restaurants in the database. They can then click on the restaurant names to view the full restaurant details.
* There is a navigation bar for users to easily navigate through the website.
* Once inside the full details page (showRestaurant.jsp), they can then choose to update or delete a restaurant based on the ID number.
* When updating a restaurant, its original values will be inside each text box, users can then choose what they would like to update. They can update everything but the restaurants ID.
* When choosing to delete a restaurant, they will be prompted with a pop-up asking if they are sure.
* They will be sent to success or failure page depending on the results of their modification to let them know the outcome.

#### Lessons Learned
* Read the project details VERY carefully on assignment.
* Do not make things more complicated than they need to be.
* Front-end/css is kinda hard, but also very fun. I still cannot get everything to be as centered as I would like.

#### Things I would do if I had more time
* Make everything centered.
* Add more restaurants .
* Create better method to reroute when an incorrect value is inputed.
